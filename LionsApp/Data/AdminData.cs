    //Should I pull data in order from a database or create objects of each admin?
    //Objects would take more RAM
    //Database takes more time but probably better. Could tag each individual with their department and then pull names/titles in alphabetical order by department when called at each department listing    

    //Could create objects of each department and then display those
    //But where else would I use those objects? No where else really
    //yeah objects aren't helpful here
    //Make a database of staff, tag them by department, then populate department tables alphabetically
    //
